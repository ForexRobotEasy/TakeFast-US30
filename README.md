# TakeFast US30

TakeFast US30 is an AI-driven forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to make market predictions and execute trades based on those predictions. This code provides a basic implementation of the TakeFast US30 trading strategy using an LSTM neural network.

## Features

- LSTM Neural Network: The code includes a LSTM class that implements the forward pass of the LSTM network. It uses a set of weights and biases to calculate the output of the network based on the input data and the previous state.

- Training Function: The main trading robot class, TakeFastUS30, includes a train function that trains the LSTM network using input and target data. It iterates over the input data, calculates the output of the LSTM network, and updates the weights and biases based on the loss between the predicted output and the target output.

- Loss Calculation: The code includes a calculate_loss function that calculates the loss between the predicted output and the target output. It uses the mean squared error loss function to measure the difference between the two outputs.

- Weight and Bias Update: The update_weights function in the TakeFastUS30 class updates the weights and biases of the LSTM network using gradient descent. This allows the network to learn from the training data and make better predictions over time.

- Execution of Trades: The execute_trades function in the TakeFastUS30 class is responsible for executing trades based on the predictions of the LSTM network. The code for interacting with the trading platform and executing trades is not included in this code snippet.

## Usage

To use the TakeFast US30 trading robot, follow these steps:

1. Load and Preprocess Historical Data: Load and preprocess historical data to be used as input and target data for training the LSTM network. The code for loading and preprocessing the data is not included in this code snippet.

2. Prepare Input and Target Data: Prepare the input and target data to be used for training the LSTM network. The code for preparing the data should be implemented based on the specific requirements of the trading strategy.

3. Train the LSTM Network: Create an instance of the TakeFastUS30 class and call the train function with the input and target data as parameters. This will train the LSTM network using the provided data.

4. Execute Trades: Call the execute_trades function to execute trades based on the predictions of the LSTM network. The code for interacting with the trading platform and executing trades should be implemented based on the specific requirements of the trading strategy.
